We first provide a primer on the data sources, including advantages, disadvantages and use cases. Historical data sources include linked census records as well as digitized maps and directories. Contemporary data come from satellites, mobile phones, social media and wikis, posted prices and listings, e-commerce and payment card transactions, newly available administrative sources, and text, among others. We then discuss the advances these data have enabled in substantive areas throughout urban and regional economics, with historical and contemporary examples in each area. We conclude with some predictions and warnings},

Twelve percent of employees hired after March 2020 live at least fifty miles from their employers in 2023, triple the pre-pandemic share. Distance from employer rose more for persons in their 30s and 40s, in highly paid employees, and in Finance, Information, and Professional Services. Among persons who stay with the same employer from one year to the next, we find net migration to states with lower top tax rates and areas with cheaper housing. These migration patterns greatly intensify after the pandemic and are much stronger for high earners. Top tax rates fell 5.2 percentage points for high earners who stayed with the same employer but switched states in 2020. Finally, we show that employers treat distant employees as a more flexible margin of adjustment.},

Leveraging data on job applications from the large job board CareerBuilder.com, we estimate the wage impact on workers’ choice among differentiated jobs in the largest occupations. We use a nested logit model of worker’s utility for applying to jobs with varying wages and characteristics, including distance from the potential worker’s home. We account for the endogeneity of wages by using several different instrumental variable strategies. We find that failing to instrument results in implausibly low elasticities, whereas plausible instruments result in more elastic estimates. Still, the implied market-level labor supply elasticity is about 0.6, while the firm-level labor supply elasticity is about 5.8. This implies that workers produce about 17\% more than their wage level, consistent with employers having significant market power even for the largest occupational labor markets.},

When preferences for the amenity are heterogeneous in the population, and its availability is heterogeneous across jobs, labor reallocation ensues. The defining traits of such reallocation (a rise in vacancies and job-to-job transitions, a fall in matching efficiency and in relative wages of jobs supplying the amenity) closely resemble those observed in the post-pandemic U.S. labor market in the aftermath of the shift to remote work. A version of the model calibrated to the U.S. experience matches the data well with shocks of plausible magnitude. Cross-sectional and survey data from various sources offer support for this mechanism.},

We then consider how work-from-home rates vary by worker age, sex, education, parental status, industry and local population density, and why it is higher in the United States than other countries. We also discuss some implications for pay, productivity, and the pace of innovation. Over the next five years, US business executives anticipate modest increases in work-from-home rates at their own companies. Other factors that portend an enduring shift to work from home include the ongoing adaptation of managerial practices and further advances in technologies, products, and tools that support remote work.},

First, uptake of remote work was abrupt and widespread in jobs suitable for telework according to the task-based measure from Dingel and Neiman (2020). The initial adoption lead to a persistent shift in work arrangements that both firms and workers forecast would continue into the future. Second, business leaders’ perceptions of how remote work affected productivity shifted over time. In early 2020, 70 percent of small business owners reported a productivity dip due to remote work. By contrast, the median business owner reported a positive productivity impact of remote work by 2021. Third, 21 percent of workers report being willing to accept a pay cut in excess of 10 percent if it allowed them to continue working from home, but the median worker in a teleworkable job would not tradeoff any compensation for the option of continued remote work. Taken together, our evidence points to perceived productivity gains and some workers’ preferences as reasons for the persistence of remote work in the years following the onset of COVID-19.},

I offer new empirical evidence that high local unemployment emerges because of elevated local job-losing rates. Local employers, rather than local workers or location-specific factors, account for most of the spatial gaps in job stability. I propose a theory in which spatial differences in job loss emerge in equilibrium because of systematic differences between employers across local labor markets. The spatial sorting decisions of employers in turn shape heterogeneity across locations. Labor market frictions induce productive employers to overvalue locating close to each other. The optimal policy incentivizes them to relocate toward areas with high job-losing rates, providing a rationale for commonly used place-based policies. I estimate the model using French administrative data. The estimated model accounts for over three-quarters of the cross-sectional dispersion in unemployment rates and for the respective contributions of job-losing and job-finding rates. Inefficient location choices by employers amplify spatial unemployment differentials fivefold. Both real-world and optimal place-based policies can yield sizable local and aggregate welfare gains.},

Our data say that 20 percent of full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before. We develop evidence on five reasons for this large shift: better-than-expected WFH experiences, new investments in physical and human capital that enable WFH, greatly diminished stigma associated with WFH, lingering concerns about crowds and contagion risks, and a pandemic-driven surge in technological innovations that support WFH. We also use our survey data to project three consequences: First, employees will enjoy large benefits from greater remote work, especially those with higher earnings. Second, the shift to WFH will directly reduce spending in major city centers by at least 5-10 percent relative to the pre-pandemic situation. Third, our data on employer plans and the relative productivity of WFH imply a 5 percent productivity boost in the post-pandemic economy due to re-optimized working arrangements. Only one-fifth of this productivity gain will show up in conventional productivity measures, because they do not capture the time savings from less commuting.},

We illustrate the method in a model of wages and labor market participation, and in a probit model with time‐varying heterogeneity. We derive asymptotic expansions of two‐step GFE estimators as the number of groups grows with the two dimensions of the panel. We propose a data‐driven rule for the number of groups, and discuss bias reduction and inference.},

The analysis highlights the interaction between a productive motive, driven by the surplus attainable in a match, and a strategic motive, driven by reciprocity of interest of potential matches. We find that the interaction between these two motives differs with preferences—vertical versus horizontal—and that this interaction implies that preferences recovered using our model can look markedly different from those recovered using a model where the degree of randomness is not endogenous. We illustrate these results using data on the U.S. marriage market and show that the model can rationalize the finding of aspirational dating.},

  abstract = {We investigate the role of information frictions in the US labor market using a new nationally representative panel dataset on individuals' labor market expectations and realizations. We find that expectations about future job offers are, on average, highly predictive of actual outcomes. Despite their predictive power, however, deviations of ex post realizations from ex ante expectations are often sizable. The panel aspect of the data allows us to study how individuals update their labor market expectations in response to such shocks. We find a strong response: an individual who receives a job offer one dollar above her expectation subsequently adjusts her expectations upward by \$0.47. The updating patterns we document are, on the whole, inconsistent with Bayesian updating. We embed the empirical evidence on expectations and learning into a model of search on- and off- the job with learning, and show that it is far better able to fit the data on reservation wages relative to a model that assumes complete information. The estimated model indicates that workers would have lower employment transition responses to changes in the value of unemployment through higher unemployment benefits than in a complete information model, suggesting that assuming workers have complete information can bias estimates of the predictions of government interventions. We use the framework to gauge the welfare costs of information frictions which arise because individuals make uninformed job acceptance decisions and find that the costs due to information frictions are sizable, but are largely mitigated by the presence of learning.},

In 1980, aggregate markups start to rise from 21\% above marginal cost to 61\% now. The increase is driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup distribution: the upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite strikingly, the median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper tail of the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share from low- to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within industry. We also find an increase in the average profit rate from 1\% to 8\%. Although there is also an increase in overhead costs, the markup increase is in excess of overhead. We discuss the macroeconomic implications of an increase in average market power, which can account for a number of secular trends in the past four decades, most notably the declining labor and capital shares as well as the decrease in labor market dynamism.},

We find that 37\% of jobs in the United States can be performed entirely at home, with significant variation across cities and industries. These jobs typically pay more than jobs that cannot be done at home and account for 46\% of all US wages. Applying our occupational classification to 85 other countries reveals that lower-income economies have a lower share of jobs that can be done at home.},

  abstract = {This paper examines how the rise of remote work affects compensation inequality. Using a novel survey, we find that the option to work remotely two days a week is highly valued by workers (equivalent to 8\% of wages on average), but it is concentrated among the better-educated and higher earners. At first glance, it seems remote work will increase inequality by offering a perk to those already better off. However, using a simple model where remote and in-person workers are complements, we show that an increase in remote work leads to lower wages for remote workers, potentially offsetting some or all of the direct benefits of remote work. Exploring the magnitudes empirically, we find that workers in remote-capable occupations experienced 2-7\% lower wage growth post-pandemic. Therefore, our inequality decomposition shows that while the option to work remotely primarily benefits workers in higher-paid jobs, the lower wage growth in these occupations fully offsets this effect. Consequently, the shift to remote work has resulted in no significant change in overall inequality, but rather a substantial increase in average compensation across the board.},

Likely contributing causes include a good technological infrastructure and comparatively widespread digital preparedness in the population. Recent research also suggests that trust is a crucial prerequisite for maintaining a spatial separation between supervisors and workers in marginal occupations. We show that survey measures of trust are extremely high in all Nordic countries, and that these measures correlate very strongly with work-from-home across countries and industries in Europe even controlling for a range of cross-country differences. Finally, we discuss potential spillover effects of increased hybrid work on the Nordic labor markets. We show evidence suggesting that increased hybrid work has caused a relocation of the production of local service firms from business centers to high-work-from-home residential areas, without affecting average commuting distances of service workers.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a tractable econometric model of optimal migration, focusing on expected income as the main economic influence on migration. The model improves on previous work in two respects: it covers optimal sequences of location decisions (rather than a single once-for-all choice) and it allows for many alternative location choices. The model is estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with a high-school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects. The results suggest that the link between income and migration decisions is driven both by geographic differences in mean wages and by a tendency to move in search of a better locational match when the income realization in the current location is unfavorable.},

  author = {Kim, Sunham},
  abstract = {Human capital is a key determinant of regional economic development. In the U.S., the varying skill production efficiencies of state-specific education systems and the dynamics of worker migration shape regional human capital, influencing economic outcomes at both the state and national levels. This paper develops a novel dynamic spatial general equilibrium model with overlapping generation framework in which heterogeneous individuals accumulate human capital and move across regions. Calibrated to U.S., the model illustrates how variations in education efficiency lead to substantial cross-state income disparities and shows that internal migration can notably boost output in states with lower education efficiencies such as North Dakota and Oklahoma. At the national level, free mobility of workers yields a 6.9\% output gain. Moreover, the model suggests that variations in human capital account for 46.6\% of the state variation per capita output. Applying the calibrated model to analyze the Obama Administration’s Race to the Top initiative finds that the \$4.1 billion grant spurred a 0.2\% increase in U.S. GDP, mostly benefiting the grant-winning states and their neighbors. Additionally, alternative grant allocation experiments show that strategic reallocation of education grants, considering regional skill production efficiencies, could further increase national GDP gains without necessarily worsening regional income disparities.},

  abstract = {We set up a search model with on-the-job search that spans random and competitive search as well as intermediate cases with partially directed search. Firms are heterogeneous in terms of productivity, and firms with different productivities are in different submarkets, with all firms in the same submarket being identical. Workers are identical, still a worker’s optimal search behavior, that is, the optimal submarket for her to visit, depends on the productivity of the current employer. The higher is the productivity of the current employer, the higher is the productivity of the firm it is optimal for the worker to target her search at. We use a discrete choice framework to model the workers’ choice of submarkets, with a single noise parameter µ governing the degree to which search is directed. As µ goes to zero, search becomes fully directed, while it becomes random as µ goes to infinity. We derive the equilibrium of the model, and simulate the equilibrium allocation. We also show how the parameter µ can be identified using a maximum likelihood approach where submarkets are identified via the Bagger and Lentz (2016) poaching rank, or in a classification step as in Lentz, Piyapromdee and Robin (2017). Alternatively, we use a simulated method of moments approach. We will identify µ on Danish and/or Norwegian matched employer-employee data.},

First, we show that, when used in conjunction with data on markups and costs, data on business dynamism can be used to disentangle these channels. Second, we estimate that both channels are necessary to explain these data between 1980 and 2016. Third, our estimated changes in technology and market structure over this period yielded positive welfare effects from reallocation and selection, but, quantitatively, these were offset by negative effects from deadweight loss and overhead. Fourth, the changes we identify replicate cross-sectional patterns in declining business dynamism, declining equilibrium wages and labor force participation, and sales reallocation toward larger, more productive firms.},

The theory of rational inattention assumes that agents cannot process all available information, but they can choose which exact pieces of information to attend to. Several important results in economics have been built around imperfect information. Nowadays, many more forms of information than ever before are available due to new technologies, and yet we are able to digest little of it. Which form of imperfect information we possess and act upon is thus largely determined by which information we choose to pay attention to. These choices are driven by current economic conditions and imply behavior that features numerous empirically supported departures from standard models. Combining these insights about human limitations with the optimizing approach of neoclassical economics yields a new, generally applicable model. (JEL D83, D91, E71)},

  author = {Oh, Ryungha},
  abstract = {Why do productive workers and firms locate together in dense cities? I develop a new theory of two-sided sorting in which both heterogeneous workers and firms sort across space. Three forces are essential for generating spatial disparities: complementarity between worker and firm productivity, random matching within frictional local labor markets, and congestion costs. I demonstrate that the equilibrium exhibits excessive concentration of workers and firms, and dispersing them away from dense locations can mitigate congestion without reducing output. I then provide direct empirical evidence of two-sided sorting using German administrative microdata. An exogenous increase in the quality of the local workforce results in more productive firms choosing the same location. Finally, to quantify the implications of the model, I calibrate it to U.S. regional data and show that policies which relocate workers and firms toward less dense areas can increase welfare.},

  abstract = {Firms are more productive, on average, in larger cities. Two main explanations have been offered: firm selection (larger cities toughen competition, allowing only the most productive to survive) and agglomeration economies (larger cities promote interactions that increase productivity), possibly reinforced by localized natural advantage. To distinguish between them, we nest a generalized version of a tractable firm selection model and a standard model of agglomeration. Stronger selection in larger cities lefttruncates the productivity distribution, whereas stronger agglomeration right-shifts and dilates the distribution. Using this prediction, French establishment-level data, and a new quantile approach, we show that firm selection cannot explain spatial productivity differences. This result holds across sectors, city size thresholds, establishment samples, and area definitions.},

  pages = {86},
  abstract = {This paper studies the nature and implications of firm wage-setting conduct on a large online job board for full-time U.S. tech workers. Utilizing granular data on the choice sets and decisions of firms and job seekers, we first develop and implement a novel estimator of worker preferences that accounts for both the vertical and horizontal differentiation of firms. The average worker is willing to pay 14\% of their salary for a standard deviation increase in firm amenities. However, at the average firm, the standard deviation of valuations of that firm’s amenities across coworkers is also equivalent to 14\% of their salaries, indicating that preferences are not well-described by a single ranking of firms. Following the modern Industrial Organization literature, we use our labor supply estimates to compute the wage markdowns implied by a series of models of firm conduct that vary in the degree to which worker preference heterogeneity gives rise to market power. We then formulate a testing procedure that can discriminate between these models. Oligopsonistic models of wage setting are rejected in favor of monopsonistic models exhibiting near uniform markdowns of roughly 18\%. Relative to a competitive benchmark, imperfect competition substantially exacerbates gender gaps in both wages and welfare. However, blinding employers to the gender of candidates would have negligible effects on wage inequality.},

In the United States, the standard deviation of the vacancy-unemployment ratio is almost 20 times as large as the standard deviation of average labor productivity, while the search model predicts that the two variables should have nearly the same volatility. A shock that changes average labor productivity primarily alters the present value of wages, generating only a small movement along a downward-sloping Beveridge curve (unemploymentvacancy locus). A shock to the separation rate generates a counterfactually positive correlation between unemployment and vacancies. In both cases, the model exhibits virtually no propagation.},

These models share features with traditional search theory, but also differ in important ways. They share features with general equilibrium theory, but with explicit frictions. Equilibria are often efficient, mainly because markets price goods plus the time required to get them. The approach is tractable and arguably realistic. Results are presented for finite and continuum economies. Private information and sorting with heterogeneity are analyzed. While emphasizing issues and applications, we also provide several hard-to-find technical results. (JEL D50, D83)},

A measure of cultural individualism accounts for about one-third of the cross-country variation in WFH rates. Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US score highly on individualism and WFH rates, whereas Asian countries score low on both. Other factors such as cumulative lockdown stringency, population density, industry mix, and GDP per capita also matter, but they account for less of the variation. When looking across individual workers in the United States, we find that industry mix, population density and lockdown severity help account for current WFH rates, as does the partisan leaning of the county in which the worker resides. We conclude that multiple factors influence WFH rates, and technological feasibility is only one of them.},
