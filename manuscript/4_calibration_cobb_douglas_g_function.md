**Production Function:** The baseline productivity, $A(h)$, is assumed to be linear in worker skill: $$A(h) = A_1 h$$The relative productivity of remote work, $g(h, \psi)$, is specified using a power function to capture the interaction between worker and firm characteristics in determining remote output: $$g(h, \psi) = \psi_0 h^\phi \psi^\nu$$Here, $A_1$ is a productivity scalar. In the remote productivity function, $\psi_0$ is a scaling factor, while $\phi$ and $\nu$ are the elasticities of remote productivity with respect to worker skill ($h$) and firm efficiency ($\psi$), respectively. The parameter $\phi$ is particularly important as it governs whether skill and firm technology are complements ($\phi > 0$) or substitutes ($\phi < 0$) in remote production.

These functional forms allow us to analytically characterize the thresholds that govern the optimal work arrangement. The upper threshold, $\overline{\psi}(h)$, which separates hybrid from full-remote work, is strictly decreasing in worker skill whenever skill and technology are complements ($\phi > 0$). This provides the intuitive result that higher-skilled workers require a lower level of firm efficiency to make full remote work optimal.

The shape of the lower threshold, $\underline{\psi}(h)$, is richer, as it is determined by a tension between the rising opportunity cost of remote work (the loss of a more productive worker from the office) and the skill-remote interaction effect. The nature of this trade-off depends critically on the skill-remote elasticity, $\phi$:

*   **When skill and technology are complements ($\phi > 0$):** The lower threshold has an **inverted U-shape**. For low-skill workers, the rising opportunity cost dominates, making the threshold increase with skill. For high-skill workers, the powerful complementarity effect dominates, making the threshold decrease with skill. This implies that middle-skill workers face the highest efficiency requirement to be offered a hybrid arrangement.

*   **When skill and technology are weak substitutes ($-1 < \phi < 0$):** The lower threshold is **strictly increasing**. As a worker's skill increases, they become both more valuable in the office (higher opportunity cost) and relatively less effective remotely (due to substitutability). Both forces push in the same direction, requiring a progressively higher level of firm efficiency to justify a hybrid offer.

*   **When skill and technology are strong substitutes ($\phi < -1$):** The lower threshold has a **U-shape**. For low-skill workers, the strong substitutability effect is dominant, causing the threshold to fall with skill. For high-skill workers, the opportunity cost effect eventually dominates again, causing the threshold to rise. This implies that middle-skill workers are the *most* likely to receive a hybrid offer.

This rich set of possibilities highlights the flexibility of the framework in capturing diverse sorting patterns. The full mathematical derivation of these cases and the formulas are presented in @sec-appendix-g-cd
