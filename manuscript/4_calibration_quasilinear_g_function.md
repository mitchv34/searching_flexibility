*   **Production Function:** The baseline productivity, $A(h)$, is assumed to be linear in worker skill, while the relative productivity of remote work, $g(h, \psi)$, is specified as a semi-logarithmic function to capture complementarities with diminishing returns.
    $$A(h) = A_1 h$$
    $$g(h, \psi) = \nu\psi - \psi_0 + \phi\log(h)$$
    Here, $A_1$ is a general productivity scalar, $\nu$ scales the impact of firm efficiency, $\psi_0$ is a baseline friction for remote work, and $\phi$ governs the skill-remote complementarity.
