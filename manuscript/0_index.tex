\section{Model}\label{model}

This section develops a search and matching model of the labor market
with two-sided heterogeneity and endogenous remote work arrangements.
The model builds on the canonical
\textcolor{red}{ADD MAIN MODEL CITATION} framework, extended to include
heterogeneity in worker skills and firm capacity for remote work. This
framework allows us to analyze how sorting patterns, wage differentials,
and aggregate labor market outcomes are shaped by the trade-offs between
productivity and the non-pecuniary benefits of remote work.

\subsection{Environment}\label{environment}

The economy is populated by a continuum of infinitely lived workers and
a continuum of firms. Time is discrete and the horizon is infinite. Both
workers and firms are risk-neutral and discount the future at a common
rate \(\beta\).

\subsubsection{Agents}\label{agents}

\textbf{Workers} are indexed by their skill level, \(h \in \mathcal{H}\)
, which is exogenously distributed according to the cumulative
distribution function \(F_h(h)\)
\textcolor{red}{I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS MAYBE I DO UNIFORM ON THIS SIDE OF THE MARKET AND PRODUCTIVITY IS BASED ON RANK}.
Workers derive utility from their wage, \(w\), and the fraction of time
they work remotely, \(\alpha \in\). The instantaneous utility function
is given by \(u(w, \alpha)\). We assume utility is quasi-linear to
ensure that the choice of \(\alpha\) is independent of the wage
transfer, which simplifies the bargaining process. Specifically, we
adopt the functional form: \[u(w, \alpha) = w - c(1-\alpha)\] where
\(c(1-\alpha)\) represents the disutility from working in the office for
a fraction \(1-\alpha\) of the time.
\textcolor{red}{ADD PROPERTIES OF COST FUNCTION}

\textbf{Firms} are indexed by their remote work efficiency,
\(\psi \in \Psi\), which is exogenously distributed according to the
cumulative distribution function \(F_\psi(\psi)\). Firms produce a
single homogeneous good. The cost of posting \(v\) vacancies is given by
an increasing and convex function \(c(v)\).

\textbf{Production Technology:} output is generated by a match between a
worker of skill \(h\) and a firm with remote efficiency \(\psi\). The
production function depends on the share of remote work, \(\alpha\):
\[Y(\alpha \mid h, \psi) = A(h) \cdot \left[(1 - \alpha) + \alpha \cdot g(h, \psi)\right]\]
where \(A(h)\) is the baseline productivity of a worker with skill
\(h\), and \(g(h, \psi)\) is the productivity of remote work relative to
in-person work, which is normalized to one. We assume \(A'(h) > 0\), so
higher-skilled workers are more productive.

The relative productivity of remote work, \(g(h, \psi)\), is a key
feature of the model, capturing complementarities between worker skill
and firm technology. We assume \(g_\psi(h, \psi) \geq 0\) and
\(g_h(h, \psi) \geq 0\), meaning remote work is more effective in firms
with higher remote efficiency and for higher-skilled workers. The sign
of the cross-partial derivative, \(g_{h\psi}\), will determine the
nature of sorting in the market.

\subsubsection{Searching and Matching}\label{searching-and-matching}

The labor market is characterized by search frictions. Let \(u(h)\) be
the measure of unemployed workers of skill \(h\), and \(v(\psi)\) be the
number of vacancies posted by firms of type \(\psi\). The aggregate
measures of unemployed workers and vacancies are given respectively by:
\[L = \int u(h) dF_h(h) \quad  \text{and} \quad V = \int v(\psi) dF_\psi(\psi)\]
Meetings between unemployed workers and vacancies are governed by a
constant returns to scale matching function, \(M(L, V)\). The rate at
which an unemployed worker contacts a vacancy is
\(p(\theta) = M(L,V)/L\), and the rate at which a vacancy is filled is
\(q(\theta) = M(L,V)/V\), where \(\theta = V/L\) is the labor market
tightness. The probability that a searching worker meets a firm of a
specific type \(\psi\) is given by the proportion of vacancies of that
type, \(v(\psi)/V\).

\subsection{Value Functions and
Bargaining}\label{value-functions-and-bargaining}

We now define the value functions for workers and firms and describe the
bargaining process that determines wages and work arrangements.

\subsubsection{Value of Unemployment and
Vacancies}\label{value-of-unemployment-and-vacancies}

An unemployed worker of skill \(h\) receives unemployment benefits
\(b(h)\) and searches for a job. The value of being unemployed,
\(U(h)\), is described by the following Bellman equation:
\[U(h) = b(h) + \beta \mathbb{E} \left[ \max\{W(h, \psi), U(h)\} \right].\]
where \(W(h, \psi)\) is the value to a worker of being employed in a
match with a firm of type \(\psi\). The expectation is taken over the
distribution of vacancies the worker might encounter. Assuming workers
get a share \(\xi\) of the match surplus, \(S(h, \psi)\), through Nash
bargaining, we have: \[W(h, \psi) = U(h) + \xi S(h, \psi).\]The value of
unemployment can then be written as:
\[U(h) = b(h) + \beta \left[ U(h) + p(\theta) \xi \int S(h, \psi)^+ d\Gamma_v(\psi) \right]\]
where \(\Gamma_v(\psi)\) is the endogenous distribution of vacancies and
\(S(h, \psi)^+ = \max\{S(h, \psi), 0\}\). Solving for \(U(h)\) yields:
\[U(h) = \frac{b(h) + \beta p(\theta) \xi \int S(h, \psi)^+ d\Gamma_v(\psi)}{1 - \beta}\]
The value of a vacant position is zero due to a free-entry condition,
which will be detailed in the vacancy creation section.

\subsubsection{Value of a Match and Surplus
Sharing}\label{value-of-a-match-and-surplus-sharing}

A match between a worker \(h\) and a firm \(\psi\) generates a flow of
output and utility. Matches are subject to an exogenous destruction
shock with probability \(\delta\). We assume efficient bargaining: the
firm and worker first choose the remote work share \(\alpha\) to
maximize the joint value of the match, and then use the wage \(w\) to
divide the resulting surplus.

Given the quasi-linear utility, the total flow value generated by a
match is the sum of output net of the worker's disutility from in-office
work: \(Y(\alpha \mid h, \psi) - c(1-\alpha)\). The total surplus of the
match, \(S(h, \psi)\), is the difference between the value of the match,
\(J(h, \psi)\), and the worker's outside option, \(U(h)\). The surplus
evolves according to the Bellman equation:
\[S(h, \psi) = s(h, \psi) + \beta(1-\delta)S(h, \psi) - \beta p(\theta) \xi \int S(h, \psi')^+ d\gamma_v(\psi')\]
where \(s(h, \psi)\) is the flow surplus, defined as the maximized joint
value net of the worker's flow value of unemployment:
\[s(h, \psi) = \max_{\alpha \in} \left\{ Y(\alpha \mid h, \psi) - c(1-\alpha) \right\} - b(h)\]
Solving for the total match surplus gives:
\[S(h, \psi) = \frac{s(h, \psi) - \beta p(\theta) \xi \int S(h, \psi')^+ d\gamma_v(\psi')}{1 - \beta(1-\delta)}\]
This equation highlights that the value of a match depends not only on
its own flow surplus but also on the worker's expected future gains from
searching while unemployed.

\subsection{Equilibrium}\label{equilibrium}

An equilibrium in this economy consists of a set of value functions
(\(U(h)\), \(S(h, \psi)\)), policy functions for remote work
(\(\alpha^*(h, \psi)\)) and wages (\(w^*(h, \psi)\)), vacancy posting
decisions (\(v(\psi)\)), and a distribution of unemployed workers
(\(u(h)\)) and employed workers (\(n(h, \psi)\)), such that: 1. The
policy functions \(\alpha^*(h, \psi)\) and \(w^*(h, \psi)\) are
determined by efficient bargaining. 2. Firms' vacancy creation decisions
\(v(\psi)\) are optimal. 3. The labor market is in a steady state, where
the flows of workers into and out of unemployment are balanced.

\subsubsection{Optimal Work Arrangements and
Wages}\label{optimal-work-arrangements-and-wages}

The optimal remote work share, \(\alpha^*(h, \psi)\), is chosen to
maximize the flow surplus. The first-order condition for an interior
solution is \(Y'(\alpha) = c'(\alpha)\). This condition equates the
marginal gain in output from an additional unit of in-person work to the
marginal disutility for the worker. Analyzing this condition at the
boundaries \(\alpha=0\) and \(\alpha=1\) defines two skill-dependent
thresholds for firm efficiency, \(\underline{\psi}(h)\) and
\(\overline{\psi}(h)\), which partition the market into three regimes:
\[\alpha^*(h, \psi) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } \psi \leq \underline{\psi}(h) \quad \text{(Full In-Person)} \\ \alpha_{\text{interior}}(h, \psi) & \text{if } \underline{\psi}(h) < \psi < \overline{\psi}(h) \quad \text{(Hybrid)} \\ 1 & \text{if } \psi \geq \overline{\psi}(h) \quad \text{(Full Remote)} \end{cases}\]

Under the assumption of efficient bargaining, the remote work share,
\(\alpha^*(h, \psi)\), is chosen to maximize the total joint value of
the match. The wage, \(w\), is then determined as a purely
distributional transfer to ensure that the total surplus,
\(S(h, \psi)\), is divided according to the exogenously given bargaining
powers, \(\xi\) for the worker and \(1-\xi\) for the firm.

The wage is set to deliver the worker their promised lifetime value from
the match, \(W(h, \psi)\). This value is composed of their outside
option, the value of unemployment \(U(h)\), plus their share of the
total match surplus.

With the optimal physical arrangement \(\alpha^*(h, \psi)\) determined,
we can solve for the wage \(w^*(h, \psi)\) that supports this
equilibrium. The wage must be set such that the worker's value from the
match equals their outside option plus their bargained share of the
surplus. This implies that the wage must deliver the required utility
flow and compensate for any in-office disutility. \[
w^*(h, \psi) = \underbrace{\left( W(h, \psi) - \beta \mathbb{E}[W'] \right)}_{\text{Required utility flow}} \quad + \underbrace{c(\alpha^*(h, \psi))}_{\text{Compensation for in-office work}}
\]

\subsubsection{Vacancy Creation}\label{vacancy-creation}

Firms post vacancies up to the point where the marginal cost of posting
equals the expected marginal benefit. The expected benefit is the
probability of filling a vacancy, \(q(\theta)\), multiplied by the
firm's share of the expected surplus from a new match. The free-entry
condition is therefore:
\[c'(v(\psi)) = q(\theta) (1-\xi) \int S(h, \psi)^+ \frac{u(h)}{L} dF_h(h)\]
This condition determines the number of vacancies \(v(\psi)\) for each
firm type, which in turn determines the aggregate market tightness
\(\theta\) and the distributions of job-finding and job-filling
probabilities.

\subsubsection{Steady-State Flows}\label{steady-state-flows}

In a steady-state equilibrium, the mass of workers of each type and in
each state (employed or unemployed) is constant. This requires that the
flow of workers out of unemployment equals the flow into unemployment.
The flow out of unemployment for workers of skill \(h\) is:
\[p(\theta) u(h) \int \mathbb{1}_{\{S(h, \psi) > 0\}} d\Gamma_v(\psi).\]It
is the product of the mass of unemployed workers of skill \(h\) , and
their effective job-finding rate, which is the probability of meeting
any firm \(p(\theta)\) , multiplied by the probability that a meeting
results in a mutually agreeable match (i.e., one with positive surplus,
\(S(h, \psi)>0\)). The flow into unemployment is the sum of all job
destructions: \[\delta \int n(h, \psi) dF_\psi(\psi).\] The steady-state
condition (Beveridge curve) is given by equating the aggregate flows:
\[\delta \iint n(h, \psi) dF_\psi(\psi) dF_h(h) = p(\theta) \int u(h) \left( \int \mathbb{1}_{\{S(h, \psi) > 0\}} d\gamma_v(\psi) \right) dF_h(h)\]
The equilibrium is a fixed point where firms' vacancy decisions are
optimal given expected surpluses, and these surpluses are consistent
with the hiring probabilities that result from those same vacancy
decisions.

\section{Calibration}\label{calibration}

\subsection{Quantitative Specification and
Parameterization}\label{quantitative-specification-and-parameterization}

To take the model to the data and analyze its quantitative implications,
we must specify functional forms for the model's key components and
assign numerical values to the resulting parameters. We divide the
parameters into two groups: those set externally based on standard
values in the literature, and those calibrated internally to match key
moments of the U.S. labor market data.

\subsubsection{Functional Forms}\label{functional-forms}

\textcolor{red}{NEED TO SETTLE ON ONE FUNCTIONAL FORM FOR THE $g(h, \psi)$ FUNCTION}

\textbf{Production and Cost Functions:} We adopt specific functional
forms for the production and worker cost functions to derive an
analytical solution for the optimal work arrangement, \(\alpha^*\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{In-Office Cost Function:} The worker's disutility from
  in-office work is assumed to be a convex function of the time spent in
  the office, \((1-\alpha)\).
  \[c(1-\alpha) = c_0 \frac{(1-\alpha)^{1+\chi}}{1+\chi}\] The parameter
  \(c_0 > 0\) scales the overall disutility, and the curvature parameter
  \(\chi > 0\) ensures that the marginal disutility of in-office time is
  increasing, a standard feature that helps ensure well-behaved interior
  solutions for \(\alpha\).
\item
  \textbf{Production Function:} The baseline productivity, \(A(h)\), is
  assumed to be linear in worker skill, while the relative productivity
  of remote work, \(g(h, \psi)\), is specified as a semi-logarithmic
  function to capture complementarities with diminishing returns.
  \[A(h) = A_1 h\] \[g(h, \psi) = \psi_0 h^\phi \psi^\nu\] Here, \(A_1\)
  is a general productivity scalar. In the remote productivity function,
  \(\psi_{0}\) acts as a scaling factor or baseline efficiency. The
  parameters \(\phi\) and \(\nu\) are the elasticities of remote
  productivity with respect to worker skill (\(h\)) and firm efficiency
  (\(\psi\)), respectively. This multiplicative form naturally embeds a
  complementarity between skill and firm efficiency, meaning the
  marginal productivity of a worker's skill in a remote setting is
  higher at a firm with greater remote efficiency, and vice-versa.
\item
  \textbf{Production Function:} The baseline productivity, \(A(h)\), is
  assumed to be linear in worker skill, while the relative productivity
  of remote work, \(g(h, \psi)\), is specified as a semi-logarithmic
  function to capture complementarities with diminishing returns.
  \[A(h) = A_1 h\] \[g(h, \psi) = \nu\psi - \psi_0 + \phi\log(h)\] Here,
  \(A_1\) is a general productivity scalar, \(\nu\) scales the impact of
  firm efficiency, \(\psi_0\) is a baseline friction for remote work,
  and \(\phi\) governs the skill-remote complementarity.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Matching and Vacancy Costs:} The matching process and the cost
of creating jobs are specified as follows: - \textbf{Matching Function:}
We assume a standard Cobb-Douglas matching function, which exhibits
constant returns to scale. \[
M(L, V) = \gamma_{0} L^{\gamma_{1}} V^{1-\gamma_{1}}
\] where \(\gamma_0 > 0\) is matching efficiency and
\(\gamma_1 \in (0,1)\) is the elasticity of matches with respect to
unemployment.

\subsubsection{Firm's Vacancy Posting
Problem}\label{firms-vacancy-posting-problem}

A firm of type \(\psi\) chooses the number of vacancies \(v\) to post to
maximize its expected profit. The profit function is the expected
benefit minus the total cost: \[
\Pi(v(\psi)) = q B(\psi)  v - c(v)
\] where: * \(B(\psi) = (1-\xi)\mathbb{E}_h[S(h,\psi)^{+}]\) is the
firm's expected benefit \emph{per filled vacancy}. * \textbf{Vacancy
Cost Function:} The cost of posting vacancies is assumed to be a convex
function, implying a rising marginal cost to posting.
\[c(v) = \frac{\kappa_{0} v^{1+\kappa_{1}}}{1+\kappa_{1}}\] where
\(\kappa_{0} > 0\) is a cost scaling parameter and \(\kappa_{1} > 0\)
ensures convexity.

The firm's first-order condition (FOC) for profit maximization is
\(\Pi'(v) = 0\), which implies that the marginal benefit must equal the
marginal cost: \[
\Pi'(v) = 0 \quad \implies \quad q B(\psi) = c'(v) \quad \implies \quad q B(\psi) = \kappa_{0} v(\psi)^{\kappa_{1}}
\] This condition allows us to derive an equilibrium condition for
\(\theta\). Details of this derivation are provided in
Section~\ref{sec-appendix-cobb-douglas}.

\subsubsection{Calibration}\label{calibration-1}

We choose the parameter values to align the model's steady state with
key features of the pre-pandemic U.S. labor market. The model is
calibrated at a monthly frequency. The parameters are summarized in
Table 1.

\textbf{Externally Set Parameters:} Several parameters are set to
standard values from the literature. The discount factor \(\beta\) is
set to 0.996, corresponding to a 5\% annual real interest rate. The
elasticity of the matching function, \(\eta\), is set to 0.5, a common
value in the search and matching literature (Petrongolo and Pissarides,
2001).

\textbf{Internally Calibrated Parameters:} The remaining parameters are
calibrated jointly to match a set of moments from the data.

\textcolor{red}{EXAMPLE TEXT} ``The parameters of the production
function (\(A_1, \nu, \psi_0, \phi\)) and the in-office cost function
(\(c_0, \chi\)) are chosen to match the average labor productivity, the
observed share of workers in remote/hybrid arrangements, and the
estimated compensating wage differential for remote work from survey
evidence (e.g., Barrero et al., 2023a). The vacancy cost parameters
(\(c_v, \gamma\)) and matching efficiency (\(M_0\)) are disciplined by
the average labor market tightness (\(\theta\)), the job-filling rate
(\(q\)), and the elasticity of vacancies to productivity
shocks\ldots{}''

\subsection{Market Tightness Equilibrium
Derivation}\label{sec-appendix-cobb-douglas}

We assume a standard Cobb-Douglas matching function, which exhibits
constant returns to scale. \[
M(L, V) = \gamma_{0} L^{\gamma_{1}} V^{1-\gamma_{1}}
\] This function yields the following probabilities: *
\textbf{Job-Filling Rate:}
\(q(\theta) = \gamma_{0} \theta^{-\gamma_{1}}\) * \textbf{Job-Finding
Rate:} \(p(\theta) = \gamma_{0} \theta^{1-\gamma_{1}}\)

\textbf{Optimal Vacancy Posting}

We begin with the firm's FOC and solve for the optimal number of
vacancies \(v(\psi)\): \[
q B(\psi) = \kappa_{0} v(\psi)^{\kappa_{1}} \implies v(\psi) = \left( \frac{B(\psi)}{\kappa_{0}} q \right)^{1/\kappa_{1}}
\] Substituting the Cobb-Douglas job-filling rate,
\(q(\theta) = \gamma_{0} \theta^{-\gamma_{1}}\), gives the expression
for \(v(\psi)\) as a function of market tightness \(\theta\) and the
firm's expected benefit \(B(\psi)\): \[
v(\psi) = \left( \frac{B(\psi)}{\kappa_{0}} \frac{\gamma_{0}}{\theta^{\gamma_{1}}} \right)^{1/\kappa_{1}}
\]

\textbf{Equilibrium Market Tightness}

The aggregate number of vacancies, \(V\), is found by integrating
\(v(\psi)\) across all firm types: \[
V = \int v(\psi) dF_{\psi}(\psi) = \int \left( \frac{\gamma_0 B(\psi)}{\kappa_0 \theta^{\gamma_1}} \right)^{1/\kappa_1} dF_{\psi}(\psi)
\] We can factor out the terms that do not depend on the firm type
\(\psi\): \[
V = \left( \frac{\gamma_0}{\kappa_0 \theta^{\gamma_1}} \right)^{1/\kappa_1} \int [B(\psi)]^{1/\kappa_1} dF_{\psi}(\psi) = \frac{1}{\theta^{\gamma_1/\kappa_1}} \left( \frac{\gamma_0}{\kappa_0} \right)^{1/\kappa_1} \int [B(\psi)]^{1/\kappa_1} dF_{\psi}(\psi)
\] To find the equilibrium, we substitute the definition of market
tightness, \(V = \theta L\), into the left-hand side: \[
\theta L = \frac{1}{\theta^{\gamma_1/\kappa_1}} \left( \frac{\gamma_0}{\kappa_0} \right)^{1/\kappa_1} \int [B(\psi)]^{1/\kappa_1} dF_{\psi}(\psi)
\] Now, we solve for \(\theta\) by grouping all \(\theta\) terms on the
left: \[
\theta^{1 + \gamma_1/\kappa_1} L = \left( \frac{\gamma_0}{\kappa_0} \right)^{1/\kappa_1} \int [B(\psi)]^{1/\kappa_1} dF_{\psi}(\psi)
\] Finally, isolating \(\theta\) yields the closed-form solution for
equilibrium market tightness: \[
\theta = \left( \frac{1}{L} \left( \frac{\gamma_0}{\kappa_0} \right)^{1/\kappa_1} \int [B(\psi)]^{1/\kappa_1} dF_{\psi}(\psi) \right)^{\frac{\kappa_1}{\kappa_1 + \gamma_1}}
\]
