# **Estimation and Calibration Strategy**

The model is calibrated to match key features of the U.S. labor market in two distinct steady states: pre-pandemic (2019) and the "new normal" post-pandemic (2024). This approach allows us to analyze how the structural parameters of the labor market may have shifted, particularly concerning the valuation of remote work.

The parameters are divided into two groups. The first group consists of parameters that are set externally, based on standard values in the literature or straightforward calculations from aggregate data. The second group contains the core parameters that are estimated jointly to match a set of key moments that characterize the labor market in each period.

## **Group 1: Externally Calibrated Parameters**

These parameters are generally considered to be stable structural parameters or are easily pinned down from aggregate statistics.  The following table summarizes these parameters along with their values for 2019 and 2024.

| Parameter  | Description               | Source/Target                                                                                                | 2019 Value | 2024 Value |
| :--------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| $\beta$    | Discount Factor           | Matches a 5% annual real interest rate. Standard in macro models (Lise and Robin, 2017; Bagga et al., 2024). | 0.996      | 0.996      |
| $\gamma_0$ | Matching Efficiency       | Set to 1 as a normalization. The level of matching is absorbed by other parameters, primarily vacancy costs. | 1.0        | 1.0        |
| $\gamma_1$ | Matching Elasticity       | Common value in the search and matching literature (Petrongolo and Pissarides, 2001).                        | 0.5        | 0.5        |
| $\xi$      | Worker Bargaining Power   | Standard value implying equal surplus sharing (Shimer, 2005).                                                | 0.5        | 0.5        |
| $\delta$   | Exogenous Separation Rate | Matches the average monthly Layoffs and Discharges rate, calculated from JOLTS data for the target year.     | 0.012      | 0.011      |
| $\kappa_1$ | Vacancy Cost Convexity    | Imposes a standard quadratic cost function, $c(v)=\frac{\kappa_0}{2}v^{2}$                                   | 1.0        | 1.0        |

## **Group 2: Internally Estimated Parameters**

These parameters are estimated jointly for each period (2019 and 2024) using the Simulated Method of Moments (SMM). The goal is to choose the parameter values that minimize the distance between moments generated by the model and their counterparts in the data for each specific year. This allows us to see which parameters have changed following the pandemic.
### Worker Skill $(h)$ Distribution
- **Functional Form Assumption:** [@lise2017], we assume a flexible parametric form for the unobserved distribution of worker skill. Specifically, worker skill $h$ is assumed to be drawn from a Beta distribution with shape parameters $a_h > 0$ and $b_h > 0$:$$h \sim \text{Beta}(a_h, b_h)$$
- **Numerical Approximation:** To solve the model computationally, we approximate this continuous distribution by a discrete grid of $N_h$ linearly spaced points, $\{h_1, h_2, \dots, h_{N_h}\}$, on the $[0,1]$ interval.
	* **Identification via Data Moments:** The shape parameters ($a_h, b_h$) are not observed directly but are identified by how they shape the model's predictions for observable outcomes:
		* **Wage Distribution:** The mean and variance of the Beta distribution, which are functions of $a_h$ and $b_h$, directly influence the moments of the simulated wage distribution. For instance, a higher variance in the skill distribution will generate greater wage dispersion, all else equal.
		* **Sorting Patterns:** The shape of the skill distribution (e.g., its skewness) affects the supply of workers at different skill levels, which in turn influences equilibrium sorting. The observed correlation between firm characteristics ($\psi$) and wages helps to discipline the shape of the $h$ distribution.
### **Preferences & Technology**
#### In-Office Cost ($c_0, \chi$): 

These two parameters jointly define the worker's disutility from in-office work, specified by the function $c(1-\alpha) = c_0 \frac{(1-\alpha)^{1+\chi}}{1+\chi}$. While they are estimated together, they are identified by distinct features of the data: $c_0$ governs the overall *scale* or "price" of the remote work amenity, while $\chi$ governs the *curvature* of the cost, which reveals preferences for hybrid arrangements.
- **Identification of the Scale Parameter ($c_0$)**: The scale parameter $c_0$ is primarily identified by the **compensating wage differential** between in-person and remote work. It directly scales the monetary compensation a worker requires to accept a job with less remote work, holding all else equal.
	* **Mechanism:** The wage is set to deliver the worker's bargained share of the match value, plus direct compensation for any disutility from working in the office. This is formally derived from the worker's value function, $W(h, \psi) = w^* - c(1-\alpha^*) + \beta\mathbb{E}[W']$, and the surplus sharing rule, $W(h, \psi) = U(h) + \xi S(h, \psi)$. Combining these gives the wage equation:$$w^*(h, \psi) = \underbrace{\left( U(h) + \xi S(h, \psi) - \beta\mathbb{E}[W'] \right)}_{\text{Required utility flow from surplus}} \hspace{0.5cm}+ \underbrace{c_0 \frac{(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))^{1+\chi}}{1+\chi}}_{\text{Compensation for in-office disutility}}$$
	* **Identification Argument:** Consider two matches with the same total surplus $\bar{S}$, one fully remote ($\alpha_1^*=1$) and one fully in-person ($\alpha_2^*=0$). The wage difference is:$$w_2^* - w_1^* = \left[ \dots \right] + \frac{c_0}{1+\chi} - \left[ \dots \right] - 0 = \frac{c_0}{1+\chi}$$This wage gap, observable in survey data (e.g., [@bloom2021]), is directly proportional to $c_0.$ A larger observed wage premium for in-person work requires a larger $c_0$ for the model to match the data.
*   **Identification of the Curvature Parameter ($\chi$)** The curvature parameter $\chi$ is primarily identified by the **observed share of workers in hybrid arrangements**. It determines how quickly the marginal disutility of in-office work increases, thereby shaping the desirability of hybrid schedules.
	* **Mechanism:** An interior (hybrid) work arrangement is optimal when the marginal productivity gain from more in-office time equals its marginal disutility cost. The first-order condition for an interior solution is:$$\underbrace{A_1 h \cdot [1 - g(h, \psi)]}_{\text{Marginal Product of In-Office Time}} = \underbrace{c_0 (1-\alpha^*)^\chi}_{\text{Marginal Disutility of In-Office Time}}$$Solving for the optimal share of in-office time gives:$$(1-\alpha^*) = \left( \frac{A_1 h [1 - g(h, \psi)]}{c_0} \right)^{1/\chi}$$The exponent $1/\chi$ shows that $\chi$ directly governs the responsiveness of the work arrangement to the underlying economics of the match. A high $\chi$ makes hybrid arrangements optimal over a wider range of conditions.
	* **Identification Argument:** The model's predicted equilibrium share of workers in hybrid arrangements is highly sensitive to $\chi$. To match a large observed share of hybrid workers in the data, the estimation must select a high value for $\chi$.

**Joint Identification:** The parameters $c_0$ and $\chi$ are disentangled by targeting two distinct moments:
1.  The **wage gap** between remote and in-person workers identifies the ratio $\frac{c_0}{1+\chi}$.
2.  The **share of hybrid workers** identifies the curvature, $\chi$.
- By forcing the model to match both the "price" (wage gap) and the "quantity" (hybrid share) simultaneously, the estimator can separately identify the scale $c_0$ and the curvature $\chi$.
	- For example, a large wage gap could be explained by a high $c_0$ and a low $\chi$, or a moderately high $c_0$ and a high $\chi$. However, only the latter case (high $\chi$) would also be consistent with a large share of hybrid workers. By forcing the model to match both the "price" (wage gap) and the "quantity" (hybrid share) simultaneously, the estimator can separately identify the scale $c_0$ and the curvature $\chi$.
#### **Production Function $\left(A_1, \psi_0, \phi, \nu\right)$:** 

These parameters jointly determine the output of a worker-firm match.

**Baseline Productivity Scale ($A_1$):** This parameter acts as a linear scaling factor for the entire economy's productivity.
- **Mechanism:** In the production function, $A_1$ directly scales the output of every match:$$Y(\alpha | h, \psi) = \underbrace{A_1}_{\text{Aggregate Scale}} h \cdot [(1-\alpha) + \alpha \cdot g(h, \psi)]$$
- **Identification:** $A_1$ is identified by matching the average level of labor productivity in the model to the data. We target the average value of the "Nonfarm Business Sector: Real Output Per Hour of All Persons" (`OPHNFB`) series. The model's aggregate productivity is the expectation over the steady-state distribution of employed workers, $n(h, \psi)$:$$\mathbb{E}[Y] = \iint Y(\alpha^*(h,\psi)|h,\psi) n(h,\psi) \,dF_h \,dF_\psi$$The estimator adjusts $A_1$ until $\mathbb{E}[Y]$ matches its data counterpart.

**Remote Productivity Parameters ($\psi_0, \nu$):** These parameters govern the level and dispersion of remote work productivity. Their identification relies on the wage distribution **conditional on workers being in hybrid or fully remote jobs** ($\alpha^* > 0$).
- **Mechanism:** These parameters enter the production function via the relative remote productivity term, $g(h, \psi)$:$$g(h, \psi) = \underbrace{\psi_0}_{\text{Baseline Level}} \times\overbrace{h^\phi}^{\text{Worker Skill Contribution}} \times\underbrace{\psi^\nu}_{\text{Firm Contribution}}$$This term only affects output, $Y$, when $\alpha^* > 0$. Since the wage, $w^*$, is an increasing function of the total match surplus, $S$, and the surplus is an increasing function of output, the properties of $g(h, \psi)$ directly map to the properties of wages for this sub-population. The wage equation is:$$w^*(h, \psi) = \left( U(h) + \xi \overbrace{S(h, \psi)}^{\text{Affected by } \psi_0, \nu} - \beta\mathbb{E}[W'] \right) + c(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))$$
- **Identification Argument:**
	1.  **Firm-Remote Complementarity ($\nu$):** This elasticity is identified by the **slope of the wage-efficiency profile**, which we measure in the data by the **correlation between firm efficiency $\psi$ and wages**, conditional on $\alpha^* > 0$. Formally, the parameter $\nu$ directly scales the sensitivity of the total match surplus, $S(h, \psi)$, to changes in $\psi$. A steeper observed wage profile in the data therefore requires a higher $\psi$ in the model to generate a sufficiently strong surplus response. (A formal proof in the [[#Rigorous Justification]]).
		- **Data Moment:** Estimated coeficient $\hat{\beta}_1$, from a Mincer-style wage regression. This regression estimates the semi-elasticity of wages with respect to the firm's remote work efficiency, $\psi$, after controlling for observable worker characteristics. We estimate the following equation using cross-sectional data on individual workers $i$ at occupations $\psi$:$$\log(w_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \psi_{i} + \mathbf{X}_i'\Gamma + \varepsilon_i$$this regression is run **only on the subsample of workers employed in hybrid or fully remote jobs**.
        -  **Model Counterpart:** The model counterpart is the analogous regression coefficient, $\hat{\beta}_{1, \text{sim}}$, estimated from a large cross-section of simulated data generated by the model.
	2.  **Remote Productivity Scale ($\psi_0$):** Given the slope $\nu$, the scale $\psi_0$ is identified by the **average wage premium** of high-$\psi$ firms over low-$\psi$ firms, conditional on $\alpha^* > 0$. This moment pins down the overall level of the remote productivity advantage. The wage $w*$ is an increasing function of the match surplus $S(h, \psi )$, which is by output,. Therefore, the average wage premium is directly related to the average output premium. The conditional expectation of output for a firm of type $\psi$ is: $$\mathbb{E}[Y | \psi] = \mathbb{E}_h \left[ A_1 h (1-\alpha^*) + A_1 h \alpha^* \times \left( \psi_0 h^\phi \psi^\nu \right) \right] =\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_h \left[ A_1 h (1-\alpha^*) \right]}_{\text{Avg. In-Person Component}} + \underbrace{\psi_0}_{\text{Level Shifter}} \times \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_h \left[ A_1 h \alpha^* h^\phi \psi^\nu \right]}_{\text{Avg. Remote Component (unscaled)}}$$The **average wage premium** is the target moment. It is proportional to the difference in average output between high-$\psi$ and low-$\psi$ firms. This difference is:$$\mathbb{E}[Y | \psi_{\text{High}}] - \mathbb{E}[Y | \psi_{\text{Low}}] = \psi_0 \times \left( \mathbb{E}_h \left[ A_1 h \alpha^* h^\phi \psi_{\text{High}}^\nu \right] - \mathbb{E}_h \left[ A_1 h \alpha^* h^\phi \psi_{\text{Low}}^\nu \right] \right)$$This expression shows that $\psi_0$ acts as a linear multiplier on the portion of the output premium that comes from remote work. The parameter $\nu$ determines *how much larger* the unscaled remote component is for high-$\psi$ firms (i.e., it sets the slope). Given that relative difference, $\psi_0$ scales it up or down to match the absolute magnitude of the wage premium observed in the data. Therefore, to match a large average wage premium in the data for remote/hybrid workers, the estimator must choose a sufficiently large $\psi_0$ to scale up the productivity advantage of high-$\psi$ firms.
        - **Data Moment:** The target moment is the estimated **average wage premium** for firms with high remote-work efficiency, controlling for worker characteristics. This is captured by the coefficient on a dummy variable in a Mincer-style wage regression. We first partition firms into quantiles based on their remote work efficiency measure, $\psi$. For example, we can define High-$\psi$ firms as those in the top (we need some flexibility here to be able to run robustness checks), then estimate the following:$$\log(w_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathbf{I}(\psi_i \in \text{High}) + \mathbf{X}_i'\Gamma + \varepsilon_i$$this regression is run **only on the subsample of workers employed in hybrid or fully remote jobs**.
        - **Model Counterpart:** The model counterpart is the analogous regression coefficient, $\hat{\beta}_{1, \text{sim}}$, estimated from a large cross-section of simulated data generated by the model.

**Skill-Remote Complementarity ($\phi$):** This is a key parameter of interest, determining whether worker skill and firm remote technology are complements or substitutes.
- **Mechanism:** The parameter $\phi$ is the elasticity of relative remote productivity with respect to worker skill $h$. It governs the **cross-partial derivative** of the production function, which determines the nature of sorting in the market.$$
            \frac{\partial^2 Y}{\partial h \partial \psi} \propto \phi
		$$
	* If **$\phi > 0$ (Complements)**, high-skill workers are disproportionately more productive in high-$\psi$ firms. This creates gains from **positive assortative matching**.
	* If **$\phi < 0$ (Substitutes)**, high-skill workers' advantage is diminished in high-$ firms, creating gains from **negative assortative matching**.
- **Identification Argument:** The parameter $\phi$ is identified by the **sorting pattern between worker skill $h$ and firm efficiency $\psi$**. We will explore two strategies:
	1. **Identification via the Conditional Variance of Wages:** 
		- The logic is that while $\nu$ and $\psi_0$ primarily affect the *average* wage in high-$\psi$ firms, $\phi$ affects the *composition* of workers in those firms, which leaves a distinct fingerprint on the *variance* (and other higher moments) of their wage distributions.
		- This sorting directly impacts the moments of the wage distribution conditional on firm type $\phi$. We can use the **ratio of wage variances** as a powerful identifying moment.
		-  **The Data Moment:** We compute the variance of log wages separately for firms with high remote efficiency and firms with low remote efficiency and take their ratio:$$\text{Moment}_{\text{Data}} = \frac{\text{Var}(\log w | \psi \in \text{High Quantile})}{\text{Var}(\log w | \psi \in \text{Low Quantile})}$$
		- **Model Counterpart:** We simulate the model and compute the exact same ratio from the generated wage data.
		- **Identification:** The estimator chooses $\phi$ to match this ratio. The sorting induced by $\phi$ has two countervailing effects on the variance:
	        *   **Selection Effect:** Positive sorting ($\phi>0$) makes the pool of workers within high-$\psi$ firms more homogeneous in terms of skill, which tends to *decrease* wage variance.
	        *   **Returns Effect:** Positive sorting also means that the return to skill is steeper in high-$\psi$ firms, which tends to *increase* wage variance.
	        * While the net effect's direction can be ambiguous, the key is that the variance ratio will be **monotonic** in $\psi$. The estimator will find the unique value of $\phi$ that makes the model's predicted variance ratio match the one in the data, even if it doesn't know the direction of the effect *a priori*.
	2. **Identification via the Conditional Distribution of Work Arrangements**:
	    - The logic is that sorting not only affects wages but also the **optimal work arrangements** that emerge in equilibrium. The optimal share of remote work, $\alpha^*$, depends on the trade-off between the productivity gain of in-office work, $A_1 h [1 - g(h, \psi)]$, and its disutility. The term $g(h, \psi) = \psi_0 h^\phi \psi^\nu$ is central here.
		    - If **$\phi > 0$ (Complements)**, high-$h$ workers sort into high-$\psi$ firms. In these matches, the term $g(h, \psi)$ is particularly large because *both* $h$ and $\psi$ are high. This makes remote work extremely productive, pushing the optimal arrangement $\alpha^*$ towards 1 (fully remote).
		    *   Conversely, in low-$\psi$ firms (now populated by low-$h$ workers), $g(h, \psi)$ will be very small, making in-person more likely.
		    * $\psi$ is identified by how the **average share of remote work, $\mathbb{E}[\alpha]$, differs across firms with high and low $\psi$**.
		    * **The Data Moment:** We can compute the average share of remote work (e.g., average days worked from home) for workers in high-$\psi$ firms and low-$\psi$ firms and take the difference:$$\text{Moment}_{\text{Data}} = \mathbb{E}[\alpha | \psi \in \text{High Quantile}] - \mathbb{E}[\alpha | \psi \in \text{Low Quantile}]$$
		    * **The Model Counterpart:** We simulate the model and compute the same conditional difference in average.
			    * **Identification:** If the data shows a large positive difference (workers in high-$\psi$ firms work remotely much more), it implies strong sorting of productive remote workers to productive remote firms. The model needs a **positive $\psi$** to generate this powerful sorting effect. If the difference is small, it suggests sorting is weak, which is consistent with $\psi$ being close to zero.
### **Search & Matching**

*   **Vacancy Costs ($\kappa_0$):** This parameter governs the overall cost of posting vacancies and is the primary determinant of the number of vacancies firms create in equilibrium.
	* **Mechanism:** Firms post vacancies up to the point where the marginal cost equals the expected benefit. This is the free-entry condition. With a quadratic cost function ($c(v) = \frac{\kappa_0}{2}v^2$), the marginal cost is $\kappa_0 v$. This cost is equated to the firm's expected share of the surplus from a new match.
	* **Identification Argument:** The parameter $\kappa_{0}$ directly scales the cost of vacancy creation. A higher $\kappa_{0}$ makes it more expensive for firms to create jobs, leading to fewer vacancies for any given level of unemployment. Therefore, $\kappa_{0}$is the key parameter that governs the steady-state **labor market tightness**, defined as the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio ($\theta = V/U$).
	* **Data Moment:** The average **vacancy-to-unemployment ratio (V/U)** for the target year. Vacancy data is taken from the JOLTS series (JTSJOL) and unemployment data is from the CPS.
	* **Model Counterpart:** The steady-state V/U ratio generated by the model. The estimator adjusts `κ₀` until the model's tightness matches the data.

# Rigorous Justification

The key is to see how $\nu$ affects the **surplus** first, and then see how the surplus affects the wage. The Envelope Theorem applies cleanly to the surplus, which is the value function of the match optimization problem.

**Step 1: The Effect of $\psi$ on the Flow Surplus $s(h, \psi)$ (The Envelope Theorem)**

The firm and worker jointly choose $\alpha$ to maximize the flow surplus $s(h, \psi)$. The value function for this problem is the maximized flow surplus itself:
$$
s(h, \psi) = \max_{\alpha \in [0,1]} \quad \left\{ A_1 h \cdot [(1-\alpha) + \alpha g(h, \psi)] - c(1-\alpha) \right\}
$$
The Envelope Theorem states that when we differentiate $s(h, \psi)$ with respect to the parameter $\psi$, we can ignore the indirect effect of $\psi$ on the choice variable $α^*$:$$\frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = \left. \frac{\partial}{\partial \psi} \left[ A_1 h \cdot ((1-\alpha) + \alpha g(h, \psi)) - c(1-\alpha) \right] \right|_{\alpha=\alpha^*(h, \psi)}$$The only term inside the brackets that depends directly on $\psi$ is $g(h, \psi)$. So, the derivative is:$$\frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = A_1 h \cdot \alpha^*(h, \psi) \cdot \frac{\partial g(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}$$
Now, we substitute in the functional form for $g(h, \psi) = \psi_0 h^\phi \psi^\nu$:
$$\frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = A_1 h \times \alpha^*(h, \psi) \times \left( \psi_0 h^\phi \cdot \overbrace{\nu \psi^{\nu-1}}^{\text{Sensitivity to } \psi} \right) $$
Note that the sensitivity of the *flow surplus* to firm efficiency $\psi$ is directly proportional to $\nu$.

**Step 2: The Effect on Total Surplus $S(h,\psi)$ and the Wage $w^*(h, \psi)$**

1.  **From Flow to Total Surplus:** The Bellman equation for the surplus in its recursive form is:$$S(h, \psi) = s(h, \psi) + \beta(1-\delta) S(h, \psi) - \beta p(\theta) \xi \mathbb{E}_{\psi'}\left[S\left(h, \psi^{\prime}\right)^{+} \mid \Gamma_{v}(\psi') \right]$$differentiate both sides of this recursive equation with respect to $\psi$, treating equilibrium objects $\theta$ and $\Gamma_v(\psi')$ as fixed, since we are interested in the *partial* effect of $\psi$ on the value of a specific match, holding the aggregate state of the economy constant:$$\frac{\partial S(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = \frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} + \beta(1-\delta) \frac{\partial S(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} - \underbrace{\frac{\partial}{\partial \psi} \left(\beta p(\theta) \xi \mathbb{E}_{\psi'}\left[S\left(h, \psi^{\prime}\right)^{+} \mid \Gamma_{v}(\psi') \right]\right)}_{\text{This term is zero}}$$The integral term is zero because $\psi$  is the characteristic of the *current* match, while the expectation is over all *potential future* matches $\psi’$. Solving for the derivative $\partial S/\partial \psi$ we obtain:$$\underbrace{\frac{\partial S(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}}_{\text{Sensitivity of Total Surplus}} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{1 - \beta(1-\delta)}}_{\text{Positive Discounting Factor}} \times \underbrace{\frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}}_{\text{Sensitivity of Flow Surplus}}$$this shows that the derivative of the total surplus  with respect to $\psi$ is directly proportional to the derivative of the flow surplus $s(h, \psi)$ with respect to $\psi$.  Furthermore, since $\beta, \delta \in (0, 1)$, the discounting factor is strictly greater than 1. This has a clear economic interpretation: the total surplus is the present-discounted value of all future flow surpluses. The factor **amplifies** the one-period effect on s because the productivity gain from a higher $\psi$ is expected to persist for the entire duration of the match. A permanent increase in the flow of surplus translates into a much larger increase in the stock value of the match. Since we already established that $\partial s / \partial \psi$ is directly proportional to $\nu$, it follows that:$$\frac{\partial S(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} \propto \nu$$2. **From Total Surplus to the Wage:** The wage is a function of both the surplus and the compensation term:$$w^*(h, \psi) = \left( U(h) + \xi S(h, \psi) - \beta\mathbb{E}[W'] \right) + c(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))$$Taking the total derivative of the wage equation with respect to $\psi$:$$
\frac{\partial w^*(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = \xi \frac{\partial S(h,\psi)}{\partial \psi} + \frac{\partial c(1-\alpha^*(h,\psi))}{\partial\psi}$$Using the chain rule on the second term: $$\frac{\partial w^*}{\partial\psi} = \underbrace{\xi \frac{\partial S(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}}_{\text{Surplus Effect} > 0} - \underbrace{c'(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi)) \times \frac{\partial \alpha^*(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}}_{\text{Compensation Adjustment Effect}}$$**Compensation Adjustment Effect:** The condition for an interior solution is the first-order condition (FOC) of the surplus maximization problem. We can use it to find an explicit expression for $\partial \alpha^* / \partial \psi$. The FOC is:$$A_1 h (1 - g(h, \psi)) = c_0(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))^{\chi}$$implicit differentiation on this entire equation with respect to $\psi$ gives:$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \psi} \left[ A_1 h (1 - g(h, \psi)) \right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \psi} \left[ c_0(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))^{\chi} \right] \quad \implies \quad  A_1 h \frac{\partial g}{\partial \psi} = c_0 \chi (1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))^{\chi-1}  \frac{\partial \alpha^*(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}\
$$since $c'(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi)) = c_0(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))^\chi$, we can rewrite the right-hand side:$$A_1 h \frac{\partial g(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = \frac{\chi}{1-\alpha^*(h, \psi)} c'(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi)) \cdot \frac{\partial \alpha^*(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}$$Solving for the **Compensation Adjustment Effect**:$$\underbrace{c'(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi)) \times \frac{\partial \alpha^*(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}}_{\text{Compensation Adjustment Effect}} = \frac{1-\alpha^*(h, \psi)}{\chi} \left( A_1 h \frac{\partial g(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} \right)$$substitute this result back into the total derivative of the wage:$$
\frac{dw^*(h, \psi)}{d\psi} = \xi \frac{\partial S(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} - \frac{(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))}{\chi}  A_1 h \frac{\partial g(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} $$We also know from our previous derivation that:$$\frac{\partial S}{\partial \psi} = \frac{1}{1 - \beta(1-\delta)} \frac{\partial s}{\partial \psi} = \frac{\partial s(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi} = A_1 h \cdot \alpha^*(h, \psi) \cdot \frac{\partial g(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}$$Substituting this in gives:$$\frac{dw^*(h, \psi)}{d\psi} = \underbrace{A_1 h \frac{\partial g(h, \psi)}{\partial \psi}}_{>0} \cdot \left[ \underbrace{\frac{\xi \alpha^*(h, \psi)}{1 - \beta(1-\delta)}}_{\text{PV of Surplus Gain}} - \underbrace{\frac{1-\alpha^*(h, \psi)}{\chi}}_{\text{Compensation Reduction}} \right]$$The wage profile is upward sloping if and only if the term in the brackets is positive, this is:$$
\frac{\xi \alpha^*(h, \psi)}{1 - \beta(1-\delta)} > \frac{1-\alpha^*(h, \psi)}{\chi} \qquad \implies \alpha^*(h, \psi) > \frac{1 - \beta(1-\delta)}{\xi \chi + 1 - \beta(1-\delta)}$$This condition shows that the positive surplus effect dominates if the worker's share of the surplus ($\xi$) and the preference for hybrid work ($\chi$) are sufficiently high, this condition will hold in the aggregate for any plausible calibration.  
- The dominant channel through which $\psi$ affects the wage is via its effect on the total surplus $S(h, \psi)$. A higher $\nu$ leads to a much larger surplus $S(h, \psi)$ in high-$\psi$ firms, and this larger surplus must be shared with the worker, leading to a higher wage. While the $c(1-\alpha^*(h, \psi))$ term also adjusts, the primary driver of the wage-$\psi$ profile is the surplus channel.
