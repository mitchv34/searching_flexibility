#### **1. Addressing the Core Feedback: Crafting a Clear and Concise Message**

Your advisor's main points were to find a simple hook, clarify the model's message, and identify a "killer application." The brainstorm produced the following key takeaways:

*   **The "Hook" (Why We Should Care):** The most compelling narratives frame the rise of remote work as a puzzle. The top ideas were:
    *   **The Inequality Paradox:** Why did wage inequality remain high in a tight labor market that should have compressed it? **Answer:** The unmeasured amenity value of remote work acted as a large, non-wage transfer to high-skill workers.
    *   **The Great Sorting:** Did remote work democratize opportunity, or did it intensify sorting, allowing the most skilled workers to concentrate in the most remote-friendly (and often highest-paying) occupations?
    *   **The Productivity Paradox 2.0:** Where did the surplus from the massive technological shift to remote work go? **Answer:** A large portion was captured by workers as an unmeasured amenity, not as firm profit or measured productivity.

*   **The Model's Unique Contribution (Why This Model):**
    *   "Our structural search framework is the first to nest individual remote-work choices into a macro equilibrium, thus disentangling the **preference** vs. **productivity** drivers of the remote wage gap and sorting."

#### **2. Empirical Strategy: Decomposing Production vs. Preferences (2019 vs. 2025)**

To address the need to empirically ground the model, the plan is to estimate parameters separately for the pre- and post-pandemic periods. The key "moments" (data targets) to match are:

*   **To Identify Preferences (`c₀`, `χ`):**
    *   **Compensating Differential:** Match the model's implied amenity value to external survey data on workers' "willingness to accept" a pay cut for remote work.
    *   **Work Arrangement Shares:** Match the observed shares of workers in Full-Remote, Hybrid, and In-Person arrangements in both periods.

*   **To Identify Production & Sorting (`φ`, `ν`, `ψ₀`):**
    *   **Wage Variance Decomposition:** Decompose wage variance into between- and within-occupation components. The model should replicate the observed rise in the within-occupation component post-pandemic.
    *   **Dynamic Transitions (Panel Data):** Match the average wage change for workers who switch to jobs with a higher remote share (`α`).
    *   **Marginal Sorting:** Match the regression coefficient from `log(ψ) ~ log(h)` on the set of "marginal" remote workers to identify the skill complementarity.

#### **3. The "Killer Application": High-Impact Counterfactuals**

The most promising counterfactuals use the estimated model to answer pressing policy and business questions:

*   **Return-to-Office Mandate:** Simulate a policy that caps the maximum remote share (`α ≤ 0.5`) for a subset of high-`ψ` occupations. **Key Question:** What is the impact on aggregate unemployment, wage dispersion, and the emergence of a "flexibility premium" for firms that do not comply?
*   **Shifting Teleworkability:** Instead of an unrealistic "all jobs are remote" scenario, simulate a more plausible shift in the *distribution* of remote efficiency (`ψ`) across occupations. **Key Question:** If mid-skill occupations become more remote-friendly, does this compress or expand the overall wage gap?

#### **4. Actionable Roadmap (Timeline to Aug 15th)**

To meet the goal of a mock job market talk by the end of August, the following timeline was established:

1.  **By Aug 8:** Finalize the list of parameters to be estimated and the specific data moments to target.
2.  **Aug 9–12:** Focus on the **estimation of pre-pandemic parameters** using 2019 data.
3.  **Aug 13–15:** Focus on the **estimation of post-pandemic parameters** using 2023/2024 data.
4.  **Aug 15 onward:** Begin the comparative analysis, run the chosen "killer" counterfactual, and start drafting the presentation slides.

#### **5. Key Extensions for Future Work**

The conversation also identified promising avenues for model extensions:

*   **Heterogeneous Preferences:** Allow workers to have idiosyncratic preferences for remote work, adding another dimension to the sorting mechanism.
*   **Endogenous Firm Technology:** Allow firms to invest in improving their remote efficiency (`ψ`), making it a choice rather than an exogenous characteristic.
